Inputs:
Weather Data
Grid Consumption
Traffic Activity


Product:
Industries can purchase subscription access to our energy plants (or use their own) → our software provides optmized buy/sell on electricity commodities/futures → profit during times of instability, offering electricity to neighborhoods at a reduced rate
Consumers can purchase the same service, but they can also subscribe for access to our plants for a safer term of investment → still profitable

This plan would not negatively hurt consumers, it would force energy companies to be more competitive → they are forced to not spike prices to take advantage of people, driving innovation and lowering costs
Keep up critical infrastructure → we can bail out the city the same way JPMorgan has bailed out the US govt

Purchase physical commodity and contracts; ratio varies depending on current circumstances

When the power is out and companies are attempting to produce more, high demand at the moment strains the grid insanely. Thus, we act as a limiting factor by purchasing contracts, reducing hardware strain and easing the transition back (from our own infra as well) → gradually re-introduce power in a way that is more beneficial for strain
